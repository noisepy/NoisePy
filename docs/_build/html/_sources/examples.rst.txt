NoisePy ASDF file architecture
===========================

The ASDF format is developed by the **Theoretical and Computation Seismology Group** at Princeton University, and
combines the capability to create comprehensive data sets including all necessary meta information with
high-performance parallel I/O for the most demanding use cases. The users who are interested in the details of this
format are referred to the following publication.

To better show the pyasdf format, we use the default examples downloaded from the pyasdf Github repository
https://github.com/SeismicData/pyasdf for creating, processing and writing ``pyasdf`` format data.
