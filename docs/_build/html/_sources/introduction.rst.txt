This is the documentation for the Python package of **NoisePy**, which is a new high-performance python tool for seismic ambient noise seismology. For further information and contact information please

Functionality
--------------

* Download continous noise data based on obspy's core functions of `get_station <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_stations.html>`_ and `get_waveforms <https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_waveforms.html>`_
* Save seismic data in `ASDF <https://asdf-definition.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ format, which convinently assembles meta, wavefrom and auxililary data into one single file (`Turtorials <https://github.com/SeismicData/pyasdf/blob/master/doc/tutorial.rst>`_ on reading/writing ASDF files)
* Offers high flexibility to handle messy SAC/miniSEED data stored on your local machine and convert them into ASDF format data that could easily be pluged into NoisePy
* Performs fast and easy cross-correlation with functionality to run in parallel through `MPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_
* Includes a series of monitoring functions to measure dv/v on the resulted cross-correlation functions using some recently developed new methods (see our papers for more details)
