    "## Tutorial: Measuring dv/v in the time, frequency, and wavelet Domains\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to reproduce the essential results in (Yuan et al. 2021). The results are mainly included into three numerical contexts, such as 1) homogeneous half-space configuration; 2) layered half-space configuration; and 3) dv/v-depth-sensitivity investigation. We are going to apply three groups of methods, including 1) WCC, TS, and DTW in time domain for raw waveforms; 2) MWCS in frequency domain, WCS, WTS, and WTDTW in wavelet domain for narrow frequency bands; 3) WCS, WTS, and WTDTW in wavelet domain for each individual frequency, to obtain dv/v results for each of three examples. We will introduce the algorithms in all mentioned approaches at first and then perform the realizations of three cases. \n",

    "### 1. Monitoring algorithms for dv/v measurements\n",
    "#### 1.1. Windowed Cross Correlation - WCC\n",
    "The main procedure of the idea is to compute the dot product at each lapse time by sliding one waveform on the other waveform. The implementation can be mathematically defined as:\n",
    "$$R(\\delta\\tau_i)=\\frac{\\int_{t_{i-w/2}}^{t_{i+w/2}}u_0(t)u(t+\\delta\\tau_i)dt}{\\sqrt{\\int_{t_{i-w/2}}^{t_{i+w/2}}u_0(t)^2dt\\int_{t_{i-w/2}}^{t_{i+w/2}}u(t)^2dt}}$$\n",
    "where $R$ is the correlation coefficient, $\\delta\\tau_i$ denotes the time shift that corresponds to $i^{th}$ lapse time $\\tau_{i}$. $w$ represents the defined window length on which the crosscorrelation works. The window length is at least two periods of waveforms. $u_0$ and $u$ are considered as the reference and current waveforms for the comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2. Trace Stretching - ST\n",
    "In the practice of TS, the time axis of one trace is rescaled with one stretch factor $\\epsilon$ as:\n",
    "$$t'=t+\\tau,$$\n",
    "$$\\tau=\\epsilon{t}.$$\n",
    "where the stretch factor is equivalent to the negative homogeneous velocity perturbation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3. Dynamic Time Warping - DTW\n",
    "Similar to the TS, we have to stretch one trace in DTW by applying time-varying shifts $s(t)$ to one trace $u(t_0)$. $t'$ would become $t+s(t)$. The shifts are lapse-time dependent rather than one constant in TS. Our target is to estimate the optimal shift function minimizing the misfit between two traces, which leads to $u(t)\\approx{u(t_0)}$. Alike to the classic optimization problem, in the first step we define a mean-squared-error function between the two traces:\n",
    "$$e(t,\\tau)=(u(t)-u_0(t+\\tau))^2,$$\n",
    "where the misfit function could be used with another norm, such as mean absolute error. We define $\\tau$ is a vector of time lags from $-\\tau_{max}$ to $+\\tau_{max}$ with the same sampling rate as the trace ($dt=d\\tau$).\n",
    "In the second step, we shall accumulate the computed errors in lapse time and time lag:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    d(t_1,\\tau) = e(t_1,\\tau), \\\\ \n",
    "    d(t_i,\\tau_j) = e(t_i,\\tau_j)+min\\begin{cases}\n",
    "               d(t_{i-1},\\tau_{j-1})\\\\\n",
    "               d(t_{i-1},\\tau_{j})\\\\\n",
    "               d(t_{i-1},\\tau_{j+1})\n",
    "            \\end{cases},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $d(t,\\tau)$ is called as the distance function. $i$ is an integer that belongs to $[2,N]$, and $N$ is the number of time samples in the trace; $j$ is an integer that belongs to $[2, M-1]$, and $M$ is the length of the $\\tau$ vector. It is therefore not hardly understood that the distance function is constrained by the maximum distance $\\tau_{max}$ and maximum time interval $dt$. In practice, we have to ensure the time shifts resulted from the $dv/v$ within the $\\tau_{max}$. Additionally, in order to limit the maximum $dv/v$, we apply the boundary conditions on the above equation and rewrite as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    d(t_1,\\tau) = e(t_1,\\tau), \\\\ \n",
    "    d(t_i,\\tau_j) = e(t_i,\\tau_j)+min\\begin{cases}\n",
    "               d(t_{i-b},\\tau_{j-1})+\\sum_{c=i-1}^{i-b+1}{e(t_c,\\tau_{j-1})}\\\\\n",
    "               d(t_{i-1},\\tau_{j})\\\\\n",
    "               d(t_{i-b},\\tau_{j+1}+\\sum_{c=i-1}^{i-b+1}{e(t_c,\\tau_{j+1})})\n",
    "            \\end{cases},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the integer parameter $b\\geq2$ and the integer $i$ belongs to $[b+1,N]$. The maximum time step here becomes $d\\tau/b$ instead of $dt$, which may constrain the maximum $dv/v$ by setting the parameter $b$. For example, the maximum $\\delta{v}/v$ becomes 50$\\%$ if the parameter $b$ equals to $2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the accumulation, the backtracking is performed to find the optimal warping path minimizing the accumulated distance. We start finding the minimum with the last time sample $N$ in time window and recursively back to the first time sample $1$. During finding the time lags for previous time samples, only three time lags are compared for the minimum one. The process of the entire backtracking can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    D(N)=\\arg\\min\\limits_{\\tau}d(t_N,\\tau), \\\\\n",
    "    D(i)=\\arg\\min\\limits_{\\tau\\in{[D(i)-1,D(i),D(i)+1]}}d(t_N,\\tau).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the integer $i$ belongs to $[1,N-1]$. The searched warping path gives the set of lags that optimally minimizing two traces. The $dv/v$ is then obtained by the linear regression of these lags over lapse times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4. Moving Window Cross Spectral - MWCS\n",
    "Different from the WCC, each lag would be calculated in frequency domain rather than time domain. Provided with two traces, we extract the windowed pair of waveforms at the same lapse time and calculate their cross-spectrum as follows:\n",
    "$$X(f)=F_0(f)F^{\\ast}(f),$$\n",
    "where $F_0(f)$ and $F^{\\ast}(f)$ are Fourier-transformed representations of the windowed waveforms, $f$ is frequency in $Hz$ and $\\ast$ denotes complex conjugation. After the cross-correlation of two Fourier transformations, $X(f)$ is expressed in the form as:\n",
    "$$X(f)=|X(f)|e^{i\\phi(f)},$$\n",
    "where $|X(f)|$ and $\\phi(f)$ represents the amplitude and phase of the complex cross spectrum. The time shifts can be determined as a slope of a linear regression between phases of the cross spectrum and frequencies according to the equation written as:\n",
    "$$\\phi(f)=2\\pi\\delta{t}f.$$\n",
    "where $\\delta{t}$ is the time shift of the lapse time centered the time window. With the above equation, we continually obtain time shifts by sliding a time window over the coda waves. Under the assumption of homogeneous velocity change of the space sampled by coda waves, we can further gain a $dv/v$ by regressing the measured time shifts over the lapse times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.5. Wavelet cross spectrum - WCS\n",
    "As only continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is applied, we define the discrete version of CWT by the following convolution:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    W_n{(s)}=\\sum_{n'=1}^{N}{x_{n'}\\psi^{\\ast}{[\\frac{(n'-n)\\delta{t}}{s}]}}, \\\\\n",
    "    \\psi{[\\frac{(n'-n)\\delta{t}}{s}]}=(\\frac{\\delta{t}}{s})^{1/2}\\psi_0{[\\frac{(n'-n)\\delta{t}}{s}]},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $x_n$ is a discrete time series with a uniform time interval $\\delta{t}$, $n$ is an integer from $1$ to $N$. $\\psi_{n,s}$ is the normalized wavelet with the unit energy, which is created by varying the scale $s$ and translating the localized time index $n$ of the mother wavelet $\\psi_0$. After the above transform, one can construct an image $W_{n,s}$ with both the signal amplitude varying along the scale and time. To accelerate the computation, the transform can be approximated by performing the convolution of each scale for all time samples simultaneously with a discrete Fourier transform. Each scale $s$ in $W_{n,s}$ can be easily converted to the Fourier equivalent frequency $f$ for different exhibitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compare two time series in the frequency- and time-domain, analogous to the Fourier cross-spectrum, one can implement the wavelet cross-spectrum (WCS) or cross wavelet transform to extract the phase delays for each frequency and time sample of the wavelet transform function (Hudgins et al. 1993; Torrence & Compo 1998). Recently, Mao et al. (2019) extended the WCS technique to the seismic interferometry for measuring the time shifts between two seismic waveforms, the WCS of which is calculated with the equation as:\n",
    "$$WCS_n(s)=<W_{n}^{X}(s)W_{n}^{Y}(s)^{\\ast}>,$$\n",
    "where $W^{X}$ and $W^{Y}$ are the CWTs of two time series $X$ and $Y$. As Fourier cross spectrum, the obtained $WCS$ is complex valued and hence can be decomposed into amplitude $|WCS_n{(s)}|$ and phase $\\phi_n{(s)}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    WCS_n(s) =|WCS_n{(s)}|e^{n\\phi_n{(s)}}, \\\\\n",
    "    |WCS_n{(s)}| = |W_{n}^{X}(s)|\\cdot|W_{n}^{Y}(s)|, \\\\\n",
    "    \\phi_n{(s)} = \\phi_n^{X}{(s)}-\\phi_n^{Y}{(s)}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where the amplitude of cross-spectrum $|WCS_n{(s)}|$ is obtained as the dot product between the amplitude of waveform $X$, $|W_{n}^{X}(s)|$ and the amplitude of waveform $Y$, $|W_{n}^{Y}(s)|$. $\\phi_n{(s)}$ represents the delay between the phase of waveform $X$, $\\phi_n^{X}{(s)}$ and phase of waveform $Y$, $\\phi_n^{Y}{(s)}$ at time $t_i$ on a scale. The amplitude and phase of waveforms are both derived from their CWTs. A significance test can be performed to identify the region potentially affected by edge-effect artifacts (Torrence and Compo, 2003; Maraun and Kurths, 2004), which would be negligible for the following extraction of time shifts. As one can achieve the equivalent frequency to each scale, we can represent the phase delays $\\phi_n{(s)}$ as $\\phi_n{(f)}$. Therefore, the time shifts can be individually derived at each time sample and frequency as the following equation, instead of regressing phase differences along frequencies in MWCS. \n",
    "$$\\delta{t}_n{(f)}=\\frac{\\phi_n{(f)}}{2\\pi{f}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon the time shifts are gained, under the assumption of homogeneous velocity change, the $dv/v$ of each frequency can be further derived by the linear regression of the time shifts within the defined time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.6. Wavelet Transform Stretching - WTS & Wavelet Transform Dynamic Time Warping - WTDTW\n",
    "The time series reconstruction from the wavelet domain can be obtained with the following equation:\n",
    "$$\\overline{X}_n=\\frac{\\delta{j}\\delta{t^{1/2}}}{C_\\delta{\\psi_0{(0)}}}\\sum_{j=j1}^{j2}\\frac{\\mathcal{R}\\{W_n{(s_j)}\\}}{s_j^{1/2}},$$\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{R}$ denotes the real part. The factor $\\psi_0{(0)}$ removes the energy scaling. The factor $C_\\delta$ is derived by reconstructing a $\\delta$ function from its wavelet transform. It is a constant for each wavelet function and its derivation is referred to \\citep{Torrence1998tutorial}. The $\\overline{X}$ is the reconstructed time series over a band from $j_1^{th}$ to $j_2^{th}$ scale or frequency. The reconstruction is performed at a specific scale or frequency when $j_1$ equals to $j_2$. In this case, the above equation is degraded into\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\overline{X}_n =\\alpha{\\mathcal{R}\\{W_n{(s_j)}\\}},\\\\\n",
    "    \\alpha =\\frac{\\delta{j}\\delta{t^{1/2}}}{C_\\delta{\\psi_0{(0)}}s_j^{1/2}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the reconstruction equation, we can transform the wavelet function of particular frequency or frequency band back to the corresponding time series in time domain. The wavelet transform and its reconstruction of specific frequency or frequency band is equivalent to the frequency filter in the signal processing. One natural way obtaining $\\delta{v}/v$ of each frequency is applying TS or DTW on the time series filtered at each frequency with the wavelet domain. However, the reconstruction of the time series at each frequency would cost much time. We fortunately find that the real part of the wavelet transform $\\mathcal{R}\\{W_n\\}$ is used for the reconstruction and the coefficient $\\alpha$ is an independent constant, which allows us to directly use $\\mathcal{R}\\{W_n\\}$ without considering scaling $\\alpha$, since the scaling is usually ignored in extracting variations of two time series. In this way, we are permitted employing TS or DTW on the $\\mathcal{R}\\{W_n\\}$ without additional time cost."

We use zero-offset and distant-offset survey geometries to approximate the realistic monitoring observations, autocorrelation and crosscorrelation. In each of them, we perturb the whole space, shallow layer, and deep layer, respectively. The detailed depiction on the experiments are referred to our paper. We validate that the assumption of a linear increase in phase shifts with the time lags for inhomogeneous velocity change; and demonstrate the responses of estimated dv/v to different velocity-change layers.

    "In this example (see Section 4 of our paper), we aim to systematically explore this effect in a similar fashion as Obermann et al. (2013). We perturb the velocity of a thin layer that we “slide” from top to bottom with a +0.1% perturbation of the background velocities. Again, see more details about the setup of the experiments in our paper. We emphasize that the depth of velocity perturbation greatly impacts the shape of the spectrum of dv/v, which may help us to constrain and infer the depth of velocity changes."
