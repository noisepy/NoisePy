# Uncomment to run a job across multiple nodes.
# Cross-correlation:
#    The array size needs to be set to the number of days in the time range.
#    Each day will run on a separate node.
#    E.g. [2022-02-02 to 2022-02-9) -> size: 8
# Stacking:
#   The array size needs to be set to the number of station pairs to stack.
#   Each station pair will run on a separate node.
# arrayProperties:
#   size: 0  # The size of the array job.
