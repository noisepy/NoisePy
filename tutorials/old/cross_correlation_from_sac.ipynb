    "# Calculate cross correlation functions from raw noise data in SAC\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demontrates the original functionalities of Noisepy from Jiang and Denolle (2019). The core functions are identical to today's version of Noisepy. The difference is that this notebook does not use DataStores for data management and reads directly from ASDF and SAC.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was created by Chengxin Jiang (Chengxin.Jiang1@anu.edu.au) in 2020 and recently updated by Marine Denolle (mdenolle@uw.edu) in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we show some of the key steps in NoisePy for computing cross correlation functions in order for you better understand the unerlying processes of NoisePy script of S1. The input data are daily noise data recorded by two stations and here we show examples in SAC format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The steps to compuate cross correlation functions are:    \n",
    "* Load SAC data and the header info into memory\n",
    "* Break the continous data into small segments with overlaps\n",
    "* Perform Fourier Transform to convert signals into frequency-domain\n",
    "* Calculate cross correlation functions between the small time segments and choose to stack (substack) the cross correlation function of each segment and return to time domain\n",
    "* Save the function in an ASDF file\n",
    "\n",
    "More details on the descriptions of data processing, parameters for different cross correlation method and performance of NoisePy can be found in the online [documentations](https://noise-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and our paper.\n",
